# Converse
The place to have global conversations.

Converse is a project that originated from the November Kansas City Startup Weekend. The goal of Converse is to bring people from all around the world together, using conversations. Eventually, there will be automatic translation to help cross the language barrier. Finally, Converse will also have updates from people you've talked to, so people everywhere can form a global community.
